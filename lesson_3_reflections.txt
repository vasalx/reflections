*When would you want to use remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?*

There are two main cases:
1. To collaborate with other people. They can have access to the remote as well as me.
2. If I work from different places or different computers. The system can help me be in sync. 
Although I am not sure which is better in this case: Drive or DropBox.

The other case is publishing. If I would like to publish my work, I would definitely use GitHub.
